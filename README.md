# 📊 Instagram User Data Analysis Using SQL

## 📝 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing user data from Instagram using SQL. The main goal is to extract meaningful insights to support marketing decisions, improve user engagement, and provide valuable investor metrics. We used various SQL techniques to identify user trends, platform activity, and potential anomalies such as bots.

The analysis covers:
- Marketing strategies (like re-engaging inactive users)
- Contest performance
- Hashtag trends
- User registration behavior
- Platform usage statistics

## ⚙️ Tech Stack Used

- **MySQL Workbench 8.0.36**  
  Used for writing, running, and testing all SQL queries.

- **SQL (MySQL syntax)**  
  For querying and analyzing data from multiple tables including users, photos, likes, and hashtags.

## 📌 Key Findings

We performed detailed analysis and discovered the following:

1. **Loyal User Reward**: Identified the five oldest users based on registration date — these users can be rewarded for their loyalty.

2. **Inactive User Engagement**: Found users who have never posted a photo — useful for targeted re-engagement campaigns.

3. **Contest Winner Declaration**: Determined the user whose photo got the most likes — useful for running and promoting contests.

4. **Hashtag Research**: Found the top five most commonly used hashtags — useful for boosting reach and collaborations with brands.

5. **Ad Campaign Launch**: Identified the day of the week with the highest user registrations — useful to schedule app promotions.

6. **User Engagement**: Calculated the average number of posts per user — helps in measuring overall engagement on the platform.

7. **Bots & Fake Accounts**: Identified users who liked every photo on the platform — these might be bots or automated accounts.

## 📄 Report & Screenshots

We documented all our findings in a detailed report.  
✅ The report includes:
- Explanation of each query and finding  
- SQL code used for each analysis  
- Screenshots of SQL code execution from MySQL Workbench  
- Visuals and summaries of key insights

This makes the project easy to follow and suitable for showcasing in a portfolio or during interviews.
